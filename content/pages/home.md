teamDescription: >-
  Nazywam się Paulina Skorupa i jestem mgr AWF Wrocław, Master Personal Trainer
  LFA, Instruktor Fitness, Pilates oraz Indoor Cycling. Półfinalistka
  ogólno-polskiego konkursu Trener Roku w 2015 r. 


  Jestem wymagającym trenerem, który oczekuje od swoich podopiecznych pełnego
  zaangażowania. Zwracam szczególną uwagę na aspekt prozdrowotny oraz technikę
  wykonywanych ćwiczeń. Jestem fanką treningu funkcjonalnego oraz siłowego.


  Od moich podopiecznych najczęściej słyszę, że dzięki treningom ze mną są
  sprawniejsi, silniejsi, zdrowsi a przede wszystkim czują się lepiej w swoim
  ciele.

      Excellent job, started and completed when they said.

      That in itself is a minor miracle compared with all the other trades I
      have had to deal with over the past 5 months whilst doing a major house
      renovation.

      I highly recommend them.

      The construction team were fantastic when it came to filling me in with
      what was happening and the deck looks amazing.

      Hi Brett, thank you. I did make you think out of the box, you listened to
      what I wanted and came up with it and in budget. Ben did a wonderful job
      building the Orchid Lath (bush House). He left everything clean and now I
      have a Lath which is everything I wanted. Thank you Deking a job well done
